Satellite - Guster

CAPO 2
Intro: Em, C, Am (x2)

               Em   D  Am
Shining like a work of art 
Hanging on a wall of stars
Are you what I think you are?

Em     G  C        Am
You're my satellite
You're riding with me tonight
Passenger side, lighting the sky
Always the first star that I find
You're my satellite

         Em D   Am
Elevator to the moon
Just a little favorite tune
Trying to get a closer view

Em     G  C         Am
You're my satellite
You're riding with me tonight
Passenger side, lighting the sky
Always the first star that I find
You're my satellite

               Em D   Am
Maybe you will always be
Just a little out of reach

Em     G  C         Am
You're my satellite
You're riding with me tonight
Passenger side, lighting the sky
Always the first star that I find
You're my satellite
You're my satellite
