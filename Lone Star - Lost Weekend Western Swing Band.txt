Lone Star - Lost Weekend Western Swing Band


C               Em                  Am         C7
I can see that lone star from a thousand miles away

F                Em               D7             G7
Calling me back home though I've ventured far astray

E7               Am             F           G#7
When I see that beacon shining for me all alone

C                    G           C
It calls me back to Texas and to home


C    Em     Am  C7   F  Em  D7   G7  
Lone star shine down on my home town

E7   Am F  G#7 C     G  C
Fill my memory light my way


  Cm           Fm              G7            C
Cattle in the old corral, the open range all 'round

D#                B#7     D#        D#
Sunlight and the smell of new mowed hay

   G                   D7                 G             G
I remember though I've wandered and much happiness I've found

        G                 D7              G    G7
Still I wish that I could be back there today


   C               Em            Am           C7
I know my home is waiting for me by the river shore

   F                 Em                D7             G7
I know that all the ones I love will welcome me once more

   E7                Am            F                  G#7
In dreams I see them now though it seems I'm bound to roam

   C                     G           C
My thoughts are still of Texas and of home

(Instrumental break)

Cattle in the old corral, the open range all 'round
Sunlight and the smell of new mown hay
I remember though I've wandered and much happiness I've found
Still I wish that I could be back there today

I know my home is waiting for me by the river shore
I know that all the ones I love will welcome me once more
In dreams I see them now though it seems I'm bound to roam
My thoughts are still of Texas and of home
