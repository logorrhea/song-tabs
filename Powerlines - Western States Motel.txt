Powerlines - Western States Motel
=================================
Am  E7  C  F  C  F  C

Am                 E7  C
The days are long, and they sing you a song
      F   C        F            C         
About how all your troubles are gone
Am             E7         C
We hold it all inside our sunlight hands
            F      C               F    C
We'll never let it go, I think you understand

We drive around all the mystery towns
I can see it now, it's all in my head
Staring down at the gravity ground
When you're this high up, you never wanna come down

G                       F                     C
When I was lost in your eyes, was I trying to find
G        F                     C    G
A way beyond all the palm tree powerlines
(wooo... I do what I can)

Dreaming dreams of material things
I try to wake you up, I do what I can
Let me take you to some places I've seen
Down a two lane road, I know right where it goes

When I was lost in your eyes, was I trying to find
A way beyond all the palm tree powerlines

(instrumental break)

When I was lost in your eyes, was I trying to find
A way beyond all the palm tree powerlines
