Im Moving Out - The Roues Brothers

C 
Tell me what's in a kiss
        G    
If your heart's not in it

We could have wedded bliss
                     C
If we'd only begin it

I'm feelin' low down
                                F
You know what I'm talkin' about
            C
You let the blues move in 
    G          C
now I'm movin' out


C
This old house ain't a home
     G
With no love inside it

We set out pretty strong
                          C
Now we just can't fight it

I'm leavin' today
                               F
I don't want to argue or shout
            C
You let the blues move in
    G          C
now I'm movin' out


F
What's the use in buyin' a car
                     C
If you won't buy gasoline

We used to be two under par
                        
Now we can't get on the green


C
I don't know where it went
       G
But it sure went a-flyin'

Love's like dough that's been spent
                           C
Now there's no use a-cryin'

Tell me where can I go
                                   F
East or west or north or due south
            C
You let the blues move in
    G          C
now I'm movin' out
