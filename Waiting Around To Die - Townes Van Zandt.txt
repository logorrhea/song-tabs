Capo on 4 
 
Am
Sometimes I don't know where 
          Dm 
this dirty road is taking me 
         Am                          Em 
sometimes I can't even see the reason why 
Am
I guess I keep a-gamblin' 
       Dm 
lots of booze and lots of ramblin' 
    Am               Em                Am 
it's easier than just waitin' around to die 
 
One-time friends I had a ma, I even had a pa 
He beat her with a belt once cause she cried 
She told him to take care of me, she headed down to Tennessee 
It's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die 
 
 
I came of age and found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar 
She cleaned me out and hit it on the sly 
I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine and hopped a train 
Seemed easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die 
 
 
A friend said he knew where some easy money was 
We robbed a man and brother did we fly 
The posse caught up with me, drug me back to Muskogee 
It's two long years, just a-waitin' 'round to die 
 
 
Now I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last 
He don't steal or cheat or drink or lie 
His name's codeine, he's the nicest thing I've seen 
Together we're gonna wait around and die
