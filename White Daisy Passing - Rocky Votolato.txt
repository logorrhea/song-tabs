White Daisy Passing - Rocky Votolato


Am                C
Please slow it down
         Am
There’s a secret magic password
                                        G          F
That you only notice when you’re looking back at it
                G             C
And all I wanna do is turn around

          E                   Am             G      F
I'm going down to sleep on the bottom of the ocean
                 C             G                    C
Cause I couldn’t let go of the water at the setting sun
                   
        F        C
Passing white daisies, taking turns
          E                Am            
Close the door walk to the street
         F                 C
Catching raindrops on your tongue
          E     Am  G   F
And for a minute it all stops
             C                G              C
But it won’t last man, just a passing moment gone


Am             C
Please slow it down
         Am
There’s a secret place that I know
                                         G              F                   
If I could a dig a grave I’d then climb underground for good
                G           C
And all I wanna do is turn around

          E                   Am             G     F
I'm going down to sleep on the bottom of the ocean
                 C             G                    C
Cause I couldn’t let go of the water at the setting sun


        F        C
Passing white daisies, taking turns
          E              Am                F              C
All those evenings on the back deck of our first apartment
           E                 Am         G            F
They meant everything but the wind just carried them off
                 C                G              C
And you can’t go back now, just a passing moment gone

Am             C
Please slow it down
         Am
